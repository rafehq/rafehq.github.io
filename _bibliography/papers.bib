  title={The Intergenerational Transmission of Lifetime Wellbeing},
  author={Eshaghnia, Sadegh and Heckman, James and Landers{\o}, Rasmus and Qureshi, Rafeh and Ronda, Victor},
  year={2021},
  abstract={Properly measured, social mobility across generations compares parental and child
lifetime wellbeing. Widely-used estimates compare child and parental income flows measured over narrow intervals of ages, usually in the 30s. They do not capture the full life
cycle of earnings, although appealing to Mincer’s “overtaking age,” they claim to closely
approximate it. Traditional measures do not account for uncertainty and impediments
to borrowing against future income and for income from housing. This paper develops
new life cycle measures of the transmission of lifetime wellbeing using rich Danish data.
They reveal a much tighter linkage between parent and children than do currently used
snapshot income measures and higher absolute mobility in the right tails of income distributions}

  title={Income Variance - Dynamics and Their Heterogeneity},
  author={Qureshi, Rafeh},
  year={2020},
  abstract={I investigate how life-cycle events can interact the decomposition of Income volatility
into permanent and transitory shocks, and what implications it has can be represented
as a shock or if it suggests a different evolution in the underlying income dynamics. I
investigate multiple ways of modelling the underlying income process, for several defi-
nitions of income and family units, and I find that the effects of divorce on individuals’
income processes is large, particularly for definitions of income that include transfers
or capital gains. The impact is for all definitions of family units, but is highest for
dynamics of pooled resources, and then for women}
