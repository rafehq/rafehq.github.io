I am a Senior Research Specialist at <a href="https://cehd.uchicago.edu/"><strong>CEHD</strong></a>, working with Professor James Heckman, Stephen Durlauf and Salvador Navarro. I got my Master's in Economics with a focus in Econometrics from <a href="https://economics.uchicago.edu/"><strong>UChicago</strong></a>, advised by Professor Stephen Durlauf.

My current research areas of interest are labor economics and econometrics, with an interest in learning about how the multifaceted nature of skills interacts with opportunities and requirements in the labor market to explain the heterogenous impacts of policy interventions. Several of my projects have focused on the Intergenerational Elasticity of Income, and its drivers in Denmark and the US. A major project has involved trying to create a better measure to capture individualsâ€™ lifetime that would more holistically capture components of individual welfare, including notions such as credit constraints and uncertainty.
